# Basic Python Programs 🐍

This repository contains my **very first Python codes** that I wrote while learning from the **Apna College Python course**.

These programs cover the absolute basics of Python such as:

- Variables & Data Types
- If-Else Conditions
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries
- Basic pattern printing and small problems

📌 **Note:**  
This repo is purely for learning purposes and reflects my early journey into Python programming.

### 💡 Why this repo exists:

I wanted to keep track of my learning progress and share the kind of problems I solved as a complete beginner.  
If you're just starting out, feel free to fork this repo and practice along!
